# Kattis Solutions
Problem Solving [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com) Problems.

The repository is organized by programming language, then by problem name. <!-- Each problem has a README.md file that contains the problem statement, and a solution file. --> Solutions have been created using the following programming languages:
- C++
- Python
- Rust

There might exist multiple solutions to a problem, either per language and or per approach/iteration. If within the same language, I have versioned them in order of creation: v1, v2, v3, etc.
